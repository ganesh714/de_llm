# Data Engineering with LLM (de_llm)\n\nThis repository contains components for a Data Engineering pipeline integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs). The project aims to leverage LLMs for various data processing, retrieval, and reasoning tasks within a data engineering context.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n- `ingestion_agent.py`: Handles data ingestion processes.\n- `reasoning_agent.py`: Contains logic for LLM-powered reasoning over data.\n- `retrieval_agent.py`: Manages data retrieval mechanisms, possibly augmented by LLMs.\n- `main.py`: The main entry point for the application.\n- `schemas.py`: Defines data schemas used throughout the project.\n- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions.\n- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.\n- `payload.json`: Example payload for testing or demonstration.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFurther details on setup, installation, and usage will be provided here.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` (to be added) for guidelines.
