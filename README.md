# Decision Engine LLM

## Overview
This repository presents a robust framework for automating and enhancing data engineering tasks through the strategic integration of Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Leveraging powerful libraries such as **LangChain** for agent orchestration and **ChromaDB** for vector storage, this project offers a modular, scalable, and intelligent approach to managing data lifecycles, from ingestion and retrieval to complex reasoning and processing, potentially utilizing **OpenAI** models or other LLM providers.

## Key Features
-   **Agent-Based Architecture**: Utilizes specialized LLM agents (Ingestion, Retrieval, Reasoning) to handle distinct data pipeline stages.
-   **Automated Data Workflows**: Streamlines data processing, information retrieval, and analytical reasoning.
-   **Modular Design**: Enables flexibility, easy extension, and integration of new functionalities.
-   **Intelligent Data Handling**: Leverages LLMs for advanced search, context extraction, and decision-making capabilities.

## Architecture & Components
The project is organized into several distinct Python modules, each playing a crucial role:

-   `main.py`: The central orchestrator, managing agent interactions and the overall application flow.
-   `ingestion_agent.py`: An LLM-powered agent responsible for data intake, initial processing, and preparing data for subsequent steps, often involving vectorization and storage in databases like ChromaDB.
-   `retrieval_agent.py`: Focuses on intelligently fetching relevant information from various data sources using LLM capabilities, interacting with vector stores (e.g., ChromaDB) to retrieve contextual data.

-   `reasoning_agent.py`: Executes complex logical processing, analysis, and decision-making based on retrieved and processed data, utilizing LLMs for advanced inferencing.
-   `schemas.py`: Defines the data structures, ensuring consistency and clear communication across all components.
-   `utils.py`: A collection of reusable utility functions supporting agent operations and the main application.
-   `payload.json`: An example configuration file for input data or agent settings.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists all required Python packages for project execution, including `langchain`, `openai`, `chromadb`, `flask`, `pydantic`, and `python-dotenv`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   Python 3.8+

### Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ganesh714/de_llm.git
    cd de_llm
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configuration (Optional):**
    If the project requires API keys or specific environment variables (e.g., for LLM providers like OpenAI), please set them up. Typically, this involves creating a `.env` file in the root directory and adding your keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`).

## Usage
To run the main application and initiate the LLM agent workflow:

```bash
python main.py
```
(Detailed usage examples and command-line arguments can be added here based on the `main.py` implementation.)
