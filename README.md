# Data Engineering with LLM (de_llm) ðŸš€\n\nThis repository explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Data Engineering pipelines to enhance data processing, retrieval, and reasoning capabilities. The `de_llm` project aims to create intelligent data workflows that leverage the power of LLMs for various data-centric tasks.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Intelligent Data Ingestion**: Utilize LLMs to process and understand ingested data.\n- **Advanced Data Retrieval**: LLM-augmented retrieval mechanisms for more relevant data access.\n- **Data Reasoning**: Employ LLMs for complex reasoning over datasets, deriving insights and automating decisions.\n- **Modular Architecture**: Designed with distinct agents for clear separation of concerns.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nThe project is organized into several key components:\n\n- `ingestion_agent.py`: Responsible for data ingestion, preprocessing, and initial LLM-based understanding.\n- `reasoning_agent.py`: Implements LLM-powered logic for data analysis, transformation, and decision-making.\n- `retrieval_agent.py`: Manages data retrieval strategies, potentially using LLMs for semantic search and context awareness.\n- `main.py`: The main application entry point, orchestrating the different agents.\n- `schemas.py`: Defines the data models and schemas used across the project.\n- `utils.py`: A collection of utility functions and helpers.\n- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.\n- `payload.json`: An example JSON payload for demonstrating API interactions or testing.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFollow these steps to set up and run the `de_llm` project locally.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.8+\n- `pip` for package management\n- An API key for your chosen LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.), to be configured as an environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).\n\n### Installation\n\n1. **Clone the repository:**\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/ganesh714/de_llm.git\n   cd de_llm\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate`\n   ```\n\n3. **Install dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n### Configuration\n\nEnsure your LLM API key is set as an environment variable:\n```bash\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\
